# Notes on Hardware

To make your life easy use the HW described and provided by https://github.com/nic6911.

Alternatively, I used the following:

* ESP32-WROOM - development board like this one: [ESP32-WROOM](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B0D4QZ9CKD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
* 3.3V TTL to RS485 like this one: [TTL to RS485](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B09VGJCJKQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
* DC-DC buck ~4-30V down to 3.3V like this one: [DC-DC 5-30V in 3.3V out](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006486270630.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.3.2f123ab55c8Ymr&algo_pvid=5e64a96c-db1d-4b61-8346-436233c32f2c&algo_exp_id=5e64a96c-db1d-4b61-8346-436233c32f2c-1&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%223061%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21DKK%2132.19%217.25%21%21%2131.91%217.18%21%402141001d17402102246237872e307a%2112000037383092779%21sea%21DK%210%21ABX&curPageLogUid=sJNy2Mu2Vkfk&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)
